# Jubilee_9mm_MGN15_Conversion
A simple repository of upgraded components to switch the Jubilee toolchanger to 9mm Gates 2GT belts, toothed and smooth idlers, and 20T pulleys, running on MGN15 rails on Y and MGN12 rails on X.

All pulley distances assume an X distance of 16.5mm between parallel belt runs (this is the distance between the shafts on the crossbar itself. Please check if this suits your crossbar design.

IMPORTANT NOTE: you'll need to redesign all 4 reinforcement plates, since the hole positions have changed for the major shafts they are designed to support!

Please print the tool plate with the circle side down against the bed, such that the recess for the wedge locking plate is facing upwards. There are 0.2mm tall pieces of material inside the recesses for the nuts that act as cutaway support material, so you can print this at 0.2mm layer height without any supports. 

For the wings, I tend to print them standing on their rear edge and standing tall, with or without a brim (depending on your printer setup).

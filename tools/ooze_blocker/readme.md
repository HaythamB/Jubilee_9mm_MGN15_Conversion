Simple ooze blocker for parking nozzles over 3mm high temperature silicone pieces. Prevents nozzle ooze during parked position, and just makes life a little bit easier when doing multi-material prints.

You'll need 2x M5x10mm screws and 2x M5 drop-in t-nuts to assemble it. Simply sits on a 2020 extrusion below the tool which you can move up to touch the nozzle. 

I've also included a simple 8mm spacer for using with Volcanoes and standard V6 blocks on a Hemera mount.

Been using it for a few prints and it doesn't show any signs of warp. That may change, as there's no where for the heat to go except into the silicon wiper and the PLA part, but it should last a while before needing a reprint.
